# MineSweeper

Shoutout to [WebDev Simplified](https://www.youtube.com/c/WebDevSimplified) for creating the project.  
You can fine the original repo [here](https://github.com/WebDevSimplified/JavaScript-Simplified-Advanced-Projects/tree/main/15-minesweeper)

I modified only the CSS file to make it look prettier (IMHO)
